To compile, you need cmake installed on your system.

Then in the mistral folder:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

After this, you can start the Mistral GUI as:

cd ui
../build/ui/mistral_ui

Important: The UI will only start from the /mistral/ui folder

If you want to use mistral as a library, read the file example/example.cpp 
for how to link Mistral against your project.
